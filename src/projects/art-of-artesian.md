Art and Crafts of Artesian is a nonprofit organization set up to provide income opportunities to female artisans in the province of Sindh, and Baluchistan, Pakistan. The project was born put off the idea that rural communities are unable to send their children to school due lack of income and resources. After completing a community need assessment in 2014, a group of community development professional concluded that a second income in the household will tremendously improve the opportunities for the children to attend schools regularly.

While the men in the community go out and work, women, perform the traditional household work and caring for the the children and elderly. All women in the community, however, posses the skill set to sew, embroider and create beautiful handcrafted pieces for families. These artifacts include embroidered dresses, bedding, table clothes, bags and purses, and multiple other objects.

Art of Artesianâ€™s goal is to provide income opportunity to these female artisans and bring economic stability and prosperity to these families. The program model for this project is based on evidence based research proving how economic stability impact the education, health and well-being of a household.
